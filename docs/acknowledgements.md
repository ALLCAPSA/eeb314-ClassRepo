# Acknowledgements

This course is based on a fantastic textbook by [Sally Otto](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) and [Troy Day](https://mast.queensu.ca/~tday/), [A biologist's guide to mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/biomath/). I've been fortunate to have been taught by both of these excellent mentors and I hope I can do them and their book justice.

I'm also very grateful to [Leithen M'Gonigle](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/M'Gonigle/) who has slickly elaborated on [Sally's lecture notes](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bio301/Bio301/Lectures.html) in LaTeX and kindly shared them with me.

Thanks also to [Ailene McPherson](https://amacp.github.io/) who, along with Sally and Leithen, continues to help me teach this course and inspires me to become a better teacher.

Thanks are also due to [Puneeth Deraje](https://osmond-lab.github.io/people.html) who went above and beyond as the course's first TA. 

And you wouldn't be reading this without the help of [Tom Ouellette](https://tomouellette.github.io/) who did an amazing job creating this website as a course development TA.

Finally, thanks to all the students who have taken the course and given me feedback (explicit or not) -- thanks for your patience!
