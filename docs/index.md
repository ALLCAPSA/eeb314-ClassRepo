Mathematics is central to science because it provides a rigorous way to go from a set of assumptions to their logical consequences. In ecology & evolution this might be how we think a virus will spread and evolve, how climate change will impact a threatened population, or how much genetic diversity we expect to see in a randomly mating population. In this course you'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through readings, lectures, homeworks, computer labs, and a final project. Our focus is on deterministic dynamical models (recursions and differential equations) but we'll also touch on probability theory and stochastic simulations near the end.
