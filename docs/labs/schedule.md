The coding part of the labs are all available to view and download [here](https://github.com/osmond-lab/eeb314/tree/master/notebooks/labs).

Students in the course are encouraged to view and run the coding aspect of the labs through the University of Toronto's JupyterHub [here](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fosmond-lab%2Feeb314&branch=master&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Feeb314%2Fnotebooks%2Flabs%2Flab01.ipynb).
