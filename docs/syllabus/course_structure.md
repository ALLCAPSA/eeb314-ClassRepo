# Course structure

## Learning objectives
Mathematics is central to science because it provides a rigorous way to go from a set of assumptions (what we take to be true) to their logical consequences (what we want to know). In ecology & evolution this might be how we think SARS-CoV-2 may spread and evolve given a set of vaccination rates and travel restrictions, how caribou population sizes are predicted to respond to forecasted rates of climate change, or something much more abstract like the expected amount of genetic diversity in a randomly mating population. In this course we'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through readings, lectures, computer labs, and a final project. By the end of the course you will be able to:

- [x] build a model: go from a verbal description of a biological system to a set of equations
- [x] analyze a model: manipulate a set of equations into a mathematical expression of interest
- [x] interpret a model: translate mathematical expressions back into biological meaning

## Weekly tasks
- [x] read text
- [x] attend two lectures
- [x] attend one lab

## Grading scheme (tentative)
- in-class tests: 4 x 20%
- final project: 20%
