# General info

## Land acknowledgement
I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and I am grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land. For more information see [University of Toronto's land acknowledgement](https://indigenous.utoronto.ca/about/land-acknowledgement/).

## Group norms
The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights, and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another’s differences. U of T does not condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities. Please contact me  if you have any concerns. For more information see the [Code of Student Conduct](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-student-conduct-december-13-2019).

## Accessibility
The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the [Ontario Human Rights Code](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ontario-human-rights-code). This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University’s courses and programs. Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please feel free to get in touch with me and/or the [Accessibility Services office](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/).

## Religious observances
The University provides reasonable accommodation of the needs of students who observe religious holy days other than those already accommodated by ordinary scheduling and statutory holidays. Students have a responsibility to alert members of the teaching staff in a timely fashion to upcoming religious observances and anticipated absences and I will make every reasonable effort to avoid scheduling tests, examinations or other compulsory activities at these times. Please reach out to me as early as possible to communicate any anticipated absences related to religious observances, and to discuss any possible related implications for course work.

## Family care responsibilities
The University of Toronto strives to provide a family-friendly environment. You may wish to inform me if you are a student with family responsibilities. If you are a student parent or have family responsibilities, you also may wish to visit the [Family Care Office website](https://familycare.utoronto.ca).
