    "In today's lab we'll see how we can simulate a model of evolution that includes stochastic changes in allele frequency -- \"genetic drift\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our \"deterministic\" model of one-locus haploid selection, where the frequency of the $A$ allele in the next generation was exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_tW_A}{p_tW_A + (1-p_t)W_a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $p_t$ the frequency in the current generation and $W_A$ and $W_a$ the fitnesses of the $A$ and $a$ alleles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that $p_{t+1}$ does not give the frequency in the next generation. Instead, imagine there are $N$ diploid individuals in generation $t$, with allele $A$ at frequency $p_t$. Each diploid produces an infinite number of haploid gametes. This does not change the allele frequency. Now let selection alter the frequency of $A$ in the gametes, such that the allele frequency among the gametes after selection is $p'_t = \\frac{p_tW_A}{p_tW_A + (1-p_t)W_a}$. This was our expression for the allele frequency in the next generation in the deterministic model. Here, the allele frequency in the next generation is determined by sampling $2N$ haploid gametes from the infinite pool with allele frequency $p'_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we let $X_i$ be the number of $A$ alleles in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ gamete picked (which can be 0 or 1), then the this is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p'_t$, i.e., $X_i\\sim\\mathrm{Ber}(p'_t)$. The total number of $A$ alleles amongst all $2N$ chosen gametes is then $X=\\sum_{i=1}^{2N}X_i$, which is a binomial random variable with parameters $2N$ and $p'_t$, i.e., $X\\sim\\mathrm{Bin}(2N,p'_t)$. We get the allele frequency in generation $t+1$ by dividing the number of sampled $A$ alleles by the total number of alleles sampled, meaning that the allele frequency in the next generation is a random variable distributed like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{t+1} \\sim \\frac{\\mathrm{Bin}(2N,p'_t)}{2N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is called the haploid **Wright-Fisher model** (section 13.4 in the text). The key take-away is that the number of $A$ alleles in the next generation is a binomial random variable. This allows us to quickly calculate the expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}(p_{t+1}) = p'_t$$\n",

    "For example, if the diploid population size was $N=100$ and the expected frequency of $A$ alleles in the next generation was $p'_t=0.1$, then we can stochastically choose the number of $A$ alleles in the next generation with a simple random draw"
