    "In the models we've discussed so far we've taken the parameters to be fixed. In reality, many of these parameters can evolve. For example, in our model of exponential growth in discrete time \\[n(t+1)=n(t) R\\] we took $R$ to be the same for all individuals for all time. But clearly any mutation causing a larger $R$ would increase in frequency, causing the value of $R$ to increase over time. In this lecture we'll explore how to determine the direction of evolution and the stability of evolutionary endpoints for more complex models using a technique called <b>evolutionary invasion analysis</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea:\n",
    "  - determine which parameters of our model an evolving trait affects\n",
    "  - take the population to be fixed for some \"resident\" trait value\n",
    "  - determine the equilibria and stability of the system with only the resident trait\n",
    "  - derive an equation for the growth of a rare \"mutant\" allele that affects the trait\n",
    "  - ask when the mutant will invade\n",
    "  - look for potential evolutionary endpoints\n",
    "  - determine the stability of those endpoints"
