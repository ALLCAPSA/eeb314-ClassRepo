    "So far we've considered invasion into an unstructured population, i.e., there is just one type of resident and one type of mutant. We can extend this analysis to consider structured populations, age- or spatial-structure for example. The general approach is the same: find a stable resident equilibria and evaluate the Jacobian at that equilibrium to determine the mutant's invasion fitness. The only difference is that our Jacobian is no longer a 2x2 matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will demonstrate the general method with a specific example: the evolution of dominance. The motivating observation is that many deleterious alleles are recessive, meaning the wild-type allele partially shields a heterozygote individual from selection. There are many examples in humans, such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. In these examples the fitness of heterozygous individuals is indistinguishable from those without any deleterious mutations. Could the dominance of a wild-type allele over a deleterious allele be the result of adaptive evolution? To ask this question we perform an evolutionary invasion analysis on a population with genetic structure. This type of model is often referred to as a **modifier model** within the field of population genetics."

This means that selection could be responsible for making deleterious mutations recesive! However, there is a massive caveat. While the selection gradient is negative it is also proportional to $\\mu$, which is tiny. This means that selection for recessive deleterious mutations is exceptionaly weak and so is easily overwhelmed by other forces (eg, genetic drift, migration, etc). The biological reason for such weak selection is that selection only acts on the variation that is present, and deleterious mutations are very rare at mutation-selection balance, $\\mu/((1+\\mu)s/2)$.
